# Projection information
#   gridwxcomp will reproject point data to WGS84 geographic for consistency with
#   point data that is downloaded from Google Earth Engine, if the input coordinates
#   are not already in WGS84 decimal degrees then specify they are in here using EPSG
#   or ESRI code. The "grid_resolution" parameter refers to an optional fishnet grid 
#   that can be created by gridwxcomp which is always created in the WGS 84 geographic 
#   coordinate reference system, hence the resolution is in decimal degrees. gridwxcomp 
#   can also reproject point data for the generation of a point shapefile containing 
#   bias results and before performing spatial resolution.
#   Finally the interpolated rasters are reprojected back to WGS 84 and resampled once 
#   more using the output_data_resolution parameter (degrees). The example values
#   shown below refer to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) geographic coordinate system and the 
#   Lambert Conformal Conic (ESRI:102004) projected coordinate system, and these are the
#   default options if the user forgets to specify the parameters in the config file.
