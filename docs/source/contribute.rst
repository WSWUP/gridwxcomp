**Note**: If you would like to propose a major change or add significant features to gridwxcomp, please reach out to the developers before you begin. Start by creating an issue with a "new feature" tag in the repository. This allows us to give feedback and guidance during the development process, and will keep your work aligned with the project's goals.

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `gridwxcomp` repository to your GitHub account. This will allow you to work on your own copy of the project.
   
2. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes. Avoid making changes directly on the `master` branch. Branches should be named descriptively based on the feature or bug you're addressing (e.g., `fix-typo-in-docs`, `add-rainfall-forecast`).

3. **Write Tests**: If your contribution involves a new feature or a bug fix, please add corresponding tests using ``pytest``.

   ```
   Type of change: Short description
   More detailed explanation of what the change does and why it is needed.
   ```

6. **Pull Request**: Once you have completed your changes, create a pull request from your branch to the `master` branch of the ``gridwxcomp`` repository. Please ensure your pull request description explains the purpose of your changes and any relevant context.
