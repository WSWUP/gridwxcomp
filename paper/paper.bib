  abstract  = "Access to daily high-resolution gridded surface weather data
               based on direct observations and over long time periods is
               essential for many studies and applications including
               vegetation, wildlife, soil health, hydrological modelling, and
               as driver data in Earth system models. We present Daymet V4, a
               40-year daily meteorological dataset on a 1 km grid for North
               America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, providing temperature,
               precipitation, shortwave radiation, vapor pressure, snow water
               equivalent, and day length. The dataset includes an objective
               quantification of uncertainty based on strict cross-validation
               analysis for temperature and precipitation results. The dataset
               represents several improvements from a previous version, and
               this data descriptor provides complete documentation for updated
               methods. Improvements include: reductions in the timing bias of
               input reporting weather station measurements; improvement to the
               three-dimensional regression model techniques in the core
               algorithm; and a novel approach to handling high elevation
               temperature measurement biases. We show cross-validation
               analyses with the underlying weather station data to demonstrate
               the technical validity of new dataset generation methods, and to
               quantify improved accuracy.",
