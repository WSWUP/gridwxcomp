Change Log
**********

Version 0.2.0
=============

Added new functionality to download gridded datasets from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, use of configuration files (.INI) for setting GEE collection paths, and the ability to conduct spatial interpolation in specified coordinate reference systems using ERSI codes. 

The command line interface was removed, it may be returned in future updates. Also, functionality to downloading gridMET data from the OpenDAP server was removed and replaced with GEE data downloads. The functionality of snapping interpolation of bias results to the gridded data resolution and transform has also been removed. The snapping of interpolated rasters to gridded data's native geotransform was removed because Google Earth Engine data assets and image collections do not provide a reliable method for accessing the necessary information. Now a user can specify the bounding coordinates and resolution to conduct spatial interpolation, and achieve the same results in that manner. Also removed were options for spatial interpolation methods provided by the `SciPy radial basis functions <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.Rbf.html>`_. 

Examples were added for new gridded data such as ERA5-Land, and documentation and tests were added to reflect these major changes.


Version 0.1.4
=============

Add 10 meter wind direction as an optional gridMET variable to download, from command line as the ``'--optional-vars'`` argument or the ``optional_vars`` keyword argument to the ``download_gridmet_opendap`` function. Additional optional variables can now be easily added in the future. If downloaded, this variable will be written to the gridMET time series files with the header name 'wdir_deg'. This change is incorporated in version 0.1.4.post3.

Change calculation for maximum and minimum air temperature from station/gridMET ratios to station - gridMET (difference). The procedure for time aggregation has not changed.  

Improve monthly comparison plots by pairing up data at daily frequency, dropping months where less than the newly added ``day_limit`` parameter (default 10) paired days per month exist for each variable, and show gaps in line plots. 

Change default interpolation parameters (power and smooth) for inverse distance weighting algorithms to the default used by GDAL_GRID, i.e. power=2, smoothing=0.

Set default scale factor for interpolation of bias ratios to 1 which results in 4 km (snapped to gridMET) resolution GeoTIFFs as opposed to previous 400 m resolution.  

Version 0.1.3
=============

The "Filename" column in the station metadata file that is the first input to :func:`gridwxcomp.prep_input` now requires the exact full name (with or without file extension) of climate time series files to be provided. This prevents loose matching overwriting site file paths based on matching the beginning of file names only. 

Add the ``method`` option/argument to the :func:`gridwxcomp.calc_bias_ratios` function and CLI script which now has two options 'long_term_mean' (new default) or 'mean_of_annual'. The 'long_term_mean' method calculates bias ratios between station and grid variables in the following manner: long-term mean of station to long-term mean of grid for each month and other time interval. For example, for June ratios this method would take all paired data (spanning the full time period) that lie in June, then take the means of both station and grid data and then take their ratio. The other option 'mean_of_annual' (previous versions' behavior) does the following: group the station and grid data first by year and then by month and longer time intervals (growing season, summer) and calculate the ratioas station sum to grid sum for each year, finally take the mean across the years to get the final ratio. The number of days of paired data in each temporal interval that ratios are calculated for are also recorded as well as the standard deviation and coefficient of variation across years (if multiple exist in the paired input). If for any month the number of paired days is below ``day_limit`` that month is excluded for both ratio calculation methods. Also the latter method will still be used to calculate the statistics count, standard deviation and coefficient of variation if ``method='long_term_mean'``, the only thing that will be altered is the calculation of the mean ratios, e.g. "Jan_mean" or generally all the columns that end with "_mean" in the resulting output files from :func:`gridwxcomp.calc_bias_ratios`.

Bug fixes related to deprecated functionality of various :mod:`pandas` tools in newer Pandas version 1+.

Add more Travis CI test coverage for spatial grid creation, point vector file creation, spatial interpolation, zonal stats, interpolation residual calculations, etc. 

Add error handling and checks for cases where input data is missing all data causing unhandled crashes later in the workflow. 

Version 0.1.2
=============

Added the ``gridwxcomp.plot.daily_comparison`` and ``gridwxcomp.plot.monthly_comparsion`` functions back into the package namespace, fixed bugs with file i/o for plotting and remove gaps in per-month daily time series comparison plots.

Version 0.1.1
=============

Added automatic testing with travix.ci, other bug fixes.

Version 0.1.0
=============

Removed methods for downloading gridMET using the Google Earth Engine API entirely. In other words the ``gridwxcomp.download_gridmet_ee`` sub-module was removed and all calls to it within the ``gridwxcomp`` module. This was done to streamline the package and because the method was substantially slower than directly accessing the gridMET netCDF files from the thredds OpeNDAP server. Also the removal substantially reduces the package's dependencies which are already quite large.

Version 0.0.9x
==============

Add functionality to use arbitrary uniform gridded datasets (default is still gridMET). New routines to create metadata for grid data. The only requirement is that a master vector grid file is provided and that it has a cell identifier property that is of integer data type which monotonically increases by steps of 1, i.e. 1,2,3... although the spatial order of cells does not matter. The gridded time series files should be named with the suffix of this cell ID so that they can be paired to their corresponding cell locations. 

Version 0.0.7x
==============

Add download tool using `OpeNDAP <https://www.opendap.org>`_, and add unit and integration tests.

Force interpolated rasters to exactly align to gridMET cell locations when scale factor = 1.

Remove residual calculations including adding to point shapefile and creation of station residual bar plots for all variables that are not listed in ``InterpGdal.default_layers``, i.e. variables other than mean bias ratios such as coefficient of variation or standard deviation interpolations. These can still be calculated when using ``spatial.calc_pt_error`` and ``plot.station_bar_plot`` directly. This change prevents unwanted residual calculations and plots from being added to the point shapefile or residual plots from being created when using the main ``spatial`` routine.

Add package index to documentations sidebar and other docs related improvements.

Version 0.0.6x
==============

Add unit and integration tests with ``pytest`` for example data, ``prep_input.py``, ``download_gridmet_ee.py``, and ``calc_bias_ratios.py``.

Update all ``gridwxcomp`` modules (with exception of ``interpgdal.py``) to ensure that they can be used as standalone scripts without installing ``gridwxcomp``. For example, the spatial interpolation routines in ``spatial.py`` can be used from the command line

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python spatial.py <options>

The only requirement is that all the files within ``gridwxcomp/gridwxcomp`` are within the same directory. 

Add ``gridwxcomp.plot`` module to consolidate current and future graphics tools. Current tools include the following functions: ``gridwxcomp.plot.daily_comparison``, ``gridwxcomp.plot.monthly_comparison``, and the newly added ``gridwxcomp.plot.station_bar_plot``. Changed the ``gridwxcomp`` command line interface plot command to handle the three options using the new option ``[-t, --plot-type]``. 

Add year range option for ``gridwxcomp.plot.daily_comparison``, useful for adding additional data to scatter plot comparisons using multiple years data for a particular month. 

Changed docs hosting to `GitHub <https://wswup.github.io/gridwxcomp/>`_

Version 0.0.5x
==============

Functionality for climate station data that was **NOT** created by `PyWeatherQaQc <https://github.com/WSWUP/pyWeatherQAQC>`_ after ``gridwxcomp >= 0.0.55``. Climate station time series files should be in CSV format and need a "date" column with date strings that can be parsed as datetime objects, e.g. '12/01/2018' or '12-01-2018'. ``daily_comparison.py`` and ``monthly_comparison.py`` plotting modules however still require climate station input data in the format of ``PyWeatherQaQc``. 

Add monthly plotting to command line interface, change command line command "daily-comparison" to
"plot" with "daily" and "monthly" options. 

Add documentation page at `ReadTheDocs <http://gridwxcomp.readthedocs.io/>`_

Add option to re-download gridMET time series data using ``download_gridmet_ee`` for specified year range.

Version 0.0.4x
==============

Improve handling of missing data, if ratio data is missing it is generally represented by ``-999`` in text files (i.e. CSVs) and by ``nan`` in geospatial files, e.g. within point shapefiles of bias ratios. Importantly, fixed bug where gdal interpolation methods used missing data in interpolation as zeros.

Add ``util.py`` module to hold utility functions or classes which may be useful to multiple ``gridwxcomp`` modules. Added function to index a pandas DataFrame or Series that has a datetime index based on a user input year filter.

Add year filter option to ``calc_bias_ratios.py``, so that certain years or ranges of years are only used to calculate bias ratios and statistics, the file names of the summary CSV files are also modified with the year or range added as a suffix so that they can be distinguished and used for spatial interpolation. 

New function: ``spatial.calc_pt_error`` which
* calculates interpolated point ratios and residuals betwen station data
* updates summary CSV and point shapefile, copies to directory with rasters

For example, now after building point shapefile, making the extraction grid, and interpolating point bias ratios using the ``spatial`` module with default options but only interpolating two layers, the following file structure is created from the root directory holding the ratio sumary CSVs::

    .
    ├── etr_mm_summary_comp.csv
    ├── etr_mm_summary.csv
    └── spatial
        ├── etr_mm_invdist_400m
        │   ├── annual_mean.tiff
        │   ├── annual_mean.vrt
        │   ├── etr_mm_summary_comp.csv
        │   ├── etr_mm_summary_pts.cpg
        │   ├── etr_mm_summary_pts.dbf
        │   ├── etr_mm_summary_pts.prj
        │   ├── etr_mm_summary_pts.shp
        │   ├── etr_mm_summary_pts.shx
        │   ├── gridMET_stats.csv
        │   ├── growseason_mean.tiff
        │   └── growseason_mean.vrt
        ├── grid.cpg
        ├── grid.dbf
        ├── grid.prj
        ├── grid.shp
        └── grid.shx

Note, now there is a copy of the summary_comp.csv file in the directory containing the interpolated rasters, and the point shapefile is also saved there as opposed to the "spatial" dir in previous versions. The CSV in the root directory is needed for running additional interpolations, the copy also contains newly added interpolation estimates at points and error residuals which are unique to a specific interpolation run.

Change calculations of annual, growing season, and summer bias ratios to use period sum of data as opposed to mean of monthly ratios. Same for standard deviation calculations and coefficient of variation. Results in slightly more accurate values. Also add total day accounts for these time periods, add all of these fields to georeferenced point shapefile as opposed to only bias ratios in previous versions.

Version 0.0.3x
==============

First version available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gridwxcomp/>`_.

Add class ``gridwxcomp.interpgdal.InterpGdal`` for interpolation methods provided by the `gdal_grid <https://www.gdal.org/gdal_grid.html>`_ command, the most useful being inverse distance weighting to a power and inverse distance weighting to a power with n nearest neighbors. The ``InterpGdal`` object can be used on its own within Python to efficiently produce interpolated rasters of arbitrary variables from point data that is calculated by ``gridwxcomp.calc_bias_ratios``, it is also used in the main spatial interpolation workflow, e.g. the command line usage of ``gridwxcomp.spatial``, by providing additional interpolation routines in addition to the radial basis functions. Instance attributes allow for managing metadata of different interpolation outcomes such as parameter values and paths to output files.  

Added calculation of standard deviation and coefficient of variation for bias ratios to the ``gridwxcomp.calc_bias_ratios`` function.

Update file structure format for spatial interpolation and calculation of zonal statistics to gridMET cells. In previous versions a CSV file containing zonal statistics for gridMET cells was created based on the interpolation method, gridMET variable name, and interpolated raster resolution, e.g.::

        'etr_mm_gridmet_summary_linear_400m.csv'

which was saved to the output directory of ``calc_bias_ratios``, i.e. where the CSV file containing station point ratios and other statistics exists. This was problematic for tracking results created by multiple interpolation parameters such as changing the power parameter of the inverse distance weighting algorithm. So the new structure is saving a file named 'gridMET_stats.csv' to the output directory where interpolated rasters are saved for any interpolation routine, which can now be modified when conducting any interpolation. The columns in the CSV are updatedwhen layers are interpolated and zonal stats are extracted with the same out directory specified. 


Version 0.0.2x
==============

Add more robust and intuitive command line interface ``gridwxcomp`` which interfaces with all major workflows of the module as opposed to needing to access multiple submodules of ``gridwxcomp``, e.g. ``gridwxcomp.prep_input``. Also add changelog. Example use of new CLI

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gridwxcomp prep-input <station_metadata_file>

old method (still possible if ``prep_input.py`` in working directory),

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python prep-input.py -i <station_metadata_file>

Added dependencies:

* `click >= 7.0 <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/>`_

Version 0.0.1x
==============

First numbered version. Many changes occured for initial development under this version which were not released or registered to PyPI. Main workflow has beed tested on Linux and Windows including: 

* pairing climate stations with gridMET cells
* calculation of bias correction ratios of climatic variables 
* created georeferenced point shapefiles, fishnet grid 
* perform 2-D interpolation of bias ratio surface with multiple options
* exctract zonal statistics to gridMET cells of bias ratio surface
* produce interactive plots comparing time series of station and gridMET data

Package not yet hosted on PyPI however it is packaged and can be installed to the Python and system env PATHs with 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --editable .
